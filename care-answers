I’d describe my personality as thoughtful, caring, and knowledgeable

I like working with kids because I still have that childlike spark of creativity and fun in my heart

I’m looking for a job that gives me the rewarding feeling of leaving a household better off than I found it - if the kids I watch had fun and learned something while I was there, and the parents felt secure in the knowledge that their children are safe and in good hands at home, I can feel satisfied that I've done a positive thing in the world

I started working with kids when I was 6 years old (when my brother was born), spent my teen years babysitting him, his friends, and their siblings, started professionally when I was around 25 years old; I'm 34 now

In my spare time, I like to build applications and app deployment pipelines, work on my garden, write books (I've written 10 novels so far, each time I think the one I'm currently writing is good, let's cross our fingers that it's true this time), and I make friends by playing games like Pokémon and Minecraft

One thing you should know about me is I will always spend the time and effort needed to understand each person's unique perspective
